The primary cause of the drift and the need for a new resource is the change in the build_number trigger value. This could be intentional, perhaps indicating a desire to create a new resource due to a change in the build number. Alternatively, it might be an unintended change that needs investigation.

To address this drift, you should review the reason behind the change in the build number and ensure that it aligns with your infrastructure deployment plan. If the change is intentional, you can proceed with the creation of the new resource. If it's unintentional, you might need to update your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scripts or configuration to prevent unnecessary resource recreation or investigate why the build number has changed unexpectedly.


=========================================================================

The cause of this drift is that the tags that were initially set with values have been modified or removed, resulting in a mismatch between the desired (expected) and actual state of the IAM role's tags.

To resolve this drift, you may want to update your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scripts (such as Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, etc.) to reflect the desired tags for the IAM role. Alternatively, you can manually update the tags on the AWS IAM role to match the desired state. This will bring the actual configuration back in line with your intended configuration.
